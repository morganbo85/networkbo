# The Penetration Testing Process
CompTIA divides the penetration testing process into four stages,
* Planning and Coping
* Information Gathering and Vulnerability Scanning
* Attacking and Exploiting
* Reporting and Communicating Results

This process captures the majors activities involved in penetration testing.

## Planning and Scoping
As the military would say "Prior planning prevents poor performance!".  This is especially important for penetration testing.  There must be a very clear understanding between testers and their clients
* What will occur
* Clear rules of engagement
* Systems, data, processes, and activities
* A written statement of work

## Information Gathering and Vulnerability Scanning
This is the reconnaissance phase.  Here you gather as much information about the target environment as possible.  Vulnerabilities identified during this stage provide the road map for the remander of the penetration test. 

## Attacks and Exploits
Once you have a clear testing plan and have conducted reconnaissance activities you can finally break out the white hat and attempt to exploit those vulnerabilities discovered during reconnaissance and penetrate an organization's network as deeply as possible, while staying within the bounds established in the rules of engagement.  The exact techniques used during the test will vary depending on the environment the scope agreed to.  We will go into more details of this in future videos.

## Reporting and Communication

This is probably the most important part of the process. As a tester a key requirement for a successful penetration test is to provide useful information to the client about the security of their IT environment.  This should come with clear, actionable recommendations for implementing new controls and enhancing existing controls.


## The Cyber Kill Chain
While Pentesters use the CompTIA penetration testing model it's important to be familiar with its counterpart. The Cyber Kill Chain model.  This is how attackers typically organize their work.
* Reconnaissance
* Weaponization
* Delivery
* Exploitation
* Installation
* Command & Control
* Actions on Objectives
This model takes what was learned during the Gathering and Vulnerability Scanning and Attacking and Exploiting stages and expands on them

## Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance in the Cyber Kill Chain is the same as Information Gathering and Vulnerability Scanning phase of the testing process. Attackers gather open-source intelligence and conduct scans of the environment looking for weakness that can be exploited

## Weaponization
Attackers develop a specific attack tool to exploit the vulnerabilities identified during reconnaissance.  Often they use automated toolkits to deploy malware specific to the target.

## Delivery
Delivery may occur through a variety of means, including exploiting a network or application vulnerability, conducting a social engineering attack, distributing malware on an infected USB drive or other media, or sending it as an email attachment through other means.

## Exploitation
Malware gains access to the targeted system, either by the action of the attacker or the victim.  Regardless, the attacker now has a foothold on the target network.

## Installation
During this phase the attacker uses the foothold they obtained during exploitation to establish permanent or persistent, access to the target system. This could be done by creating a backdoor, that can be used to return later, creating registry entries that reopen access when closed, or installing a web shell that will allow access to the system over HTTPS.

## Command and Control
Now the attacker could use remote shell or other means to remotely control the compromised system.  They could manually control the system using the shell or connect it to an automated command and control (C2C) network.  This automated approach is common in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks where the attacker directs the actions of thousands of compromised systems, known as a botnet.

## Actions on Objectives
At this point the attacker usually tries to get deeper into the target system.  This may involve pivoting from the compromised system to another in the same organization restarting the Cyber Kill Chain.
This stage may also include theft of sensitive information, unauthorized use of computing resources to engage in denial of service attacks or to mine cryptocurrency, or the unauthorized modification or deletion of information.
