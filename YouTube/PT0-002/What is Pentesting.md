# What is penetration testing?

Penetration testing, often referred to as pen testing, is a type of cybersecurity assessment that involves simulating an attack on a computer system, network, or application to identify and exploit vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.

# Cybersecurity Goals

### Cybersecurity professionals are defined by the CIA triad:

·         Confidentiality measures seek to prevent unauthorized access to information or systems.

·         Integrity measures seek to prevent unauthorized access to information or systems

·         Availability measures seek to ensure that legitimate use of information and systems remains possible.

### However, attackers and therefore penetration testers goals are defined by the DAD triad.

·         Disclosure attacks seek to gain unauthorized access to information or systems.

·         Alteration attacks seek to make unauthorized changes to information or systems.

·         Denial attacks seek to prevent legitimate use of information and systems.

Both models are directly correlated, with each branch of the DAD triad corresponding to the branch of the CIA triad

# Adopting the Hacker Mindset

Penetration testers don’t think in terms of trying to defend against all threats.  Instead they only need to find a single vulnerability that they can exploit to achieve their goals.  In order to do this, they have to adopt the hacker mindset.

They find either one flaw in the existing controls or one scenario that was overlooked during the planning.

The attacker only needs to win once. While cybersecurity professionals need to win every time.

# Ethical Hacking

Is the art of using hacking tools and techniques while doing so within a code of ethics that regulates the activity.

·         Performing background checks on all members

·         Adhering to the defined scope of the testing engagement

·         Immediately reporting any breaches or criminal activity detected during the penetration test

·         Limiting the use of penetration testing tools to approved engagements

·         Limiting the invasiveness of a penetration test based on the scope of the engagement

·         Protecting the confidentiality of data and information related to or uncovered during a penetration test.

Failure to do this could result in fees, fines or criminal charges depending on the nature of the violation.
